A game that was built upon "Coding with Adam" pacman video as reference.

A classic 90's game that was made as a side-project for National Technology Day fest held in my college.

# About the Game:
1. Use arrow keys to move the pacman.
2. Goal is to eat up all the yellow pellets before getting eaten by the ghosts.
3. The glowing yellow pellets give you the power to eat the ghosts.
